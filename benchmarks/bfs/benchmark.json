    "description":"In Breadth-first search, a graph (comprised of vertices and edges) is read in from a file.  From this, a single-source shortest-path algorithm is computed.  This algorithm currently assumes that each edge weight is one.  However, the algorithm should be easily extendable to cover this case.  This particular program has been ported from the Rodidnia Benchmark Suite.",
