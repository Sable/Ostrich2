Baum-Welch Algorithm
===============

The Baum-Welch algorithm falls into the graphical models dwarf and has
many applications, including bioinformatics, cryptanalysis and speech
recognition. It makes use of the forward-backward algorithm and finds
the unknown parameters of a hidden Markov model (HMM).
